# Astrid script to find a point source near a target source
# This script assumes the GBT is configured for continuum observations
# You must input target for region being observed

# Input sources
srcCat = Catalog("/users/rfriesen/GAS/GAS_regions.cat")
# Include VEGAS setup 
execfile("/users/rfriesen/GAS/vegas_kfpa_config")

# Move near Target so AutoPeak finds the correct point source
target = srcName 
Slew(target)
Balance()

# Auto Peak focus finds the nearest point source near 
# the observer's target location
# Check beamName, refBeam parameters
# AutoPeakFocus() determines its own best configuration automatically 
# and does not reset the configuration after being run.

# Make sure we're back to spectral line setup (just in case)
